# Dirty Data Project
This project involved reading in several messy datasets that needed cleaning, tidying, and joining. Analysis was then carried out on the cleaned data.

## Task Summaries
#### Decathlon
A data set was provided that contained results from two decathlon competitions, Decastar and the Olympic Games. Times and distances for each of the
ten events were given, as well as each competitor’s final points total and rank in that competition.

#### Cake Ingredients
The data sets had ingredient lists for a number of cake recipes. The data is split between two csv files, one containing types of cake, codes for recipe
ingredients and number of units, the other containing the ingredient codes, their full name and the measurement units. The data sets needed to be joined
and pivoted in an appropriate way before analysis could take place.

#### Seabird Sightings
The data provided had details of seabird sightings recorded from mid 1969 to the end of 1990. Information of the birds sighted is held on a separate
sheet from the information about the location, date and time of the sightings. After joining the data sets, only a small selection of columns are
needed from the detailed records.

#### Halloween Candy
Since 2006 David Ng and Ben Cohen have conducted a light-hearted ranking of Hallowe’en candy. At first they focused on personal, anecdotal experience.
What started as an amusing exercise for their blog ballooned into a quasi-scientific analysis of public candy perceptions. This task took three years
of their messy data and attempted to make some sweeping generalisations from this not-so-reliable cross-section of society.

#### Right Wing Authoritarianism
This data was collected in 2015 from a on-line version of the Right-wing Authoritarianism Scale. Some questions were intended to give a measure of subjects'
political standing, with an "RWA Score" being calculated. Analysis focused more on personal attributes of respondees, rather than political stance.
